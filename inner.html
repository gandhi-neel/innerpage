        <h2>What is a real estate CRM software?</h2>
        <p>
          Real estate CRM software is a system that helps manage relationships
          between buyers, sellers, agents, brokers, developers, and financial
          institutions and caters to the multiple requirements of real estate
          agents and real estate firms. From managing incoming requests to
          preparing price quotes, from selling commercial real-estate to
          property management, the real estate <a href="#">CRM system</a> takes
          care of the end-to-end process management for real estate agencies.

        <h2>How is CRM important for realtors?</h2>
        <p>
          Real estate is all about building trust, and it's no surprise that 82%
          of new property sales are referrals from either existing contacts,
          previous clients, family, friends, or relatives. Moreover, when it
          comes to real estate businesses, selling or buying is a long process,
          with many follow-ups and re-negotiations. In such scenarios,
          implementing a real estate CRM software gives realtors an efficient
          way to manage contacts, schedule tasks, monitor their pipelines, and
          stay organized to build successful relationships and close deals.

      <div class="text-content">
        <h1>Manage leads and track their history</h1>
        <p>
          Generate leads from multiple sources like social media, offline
          campaigns, business cards, online campaigns and track their stages
          until they become an opportunity. Zoho CRM's lead scoring lets you see
          which prospects your team needs to focus on. Once an inquiry enters
          your pipeline, you can set up automated email responses to nurture
          them and drive engagement.

        <p>
          Automatically assign leads to sales reps using predefined workflow
          rules based on territory, industry, potential deal size, or even in
          round robin fashion. Every time a lead enters your CRM pipeline, you
          can notify the assigned sales rep and assign tasks and reminders to
          followup. Automate your follow up emails, Zoho CRM field updates, and
          notifications to give your sales reps time to close more deals.
